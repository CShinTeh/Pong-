# Pong-
My beginner project for learning C++ with SDL2.
Attempting to implement good programming practices and object-oriented concepts to the program for learning purposes.


SDL and SDL_tff library is not included in the repository.
The release version can be found in the 'release' folder, make sure every file is in the same directory and run the .exe file to start the program.
